### First version of own sechmatics and PCBs is released 17.04.2023

Basic and minimal sechmatics of this project for working twinkling christmas light with changing polarity of led to change color. 

The circuit is worked change color of light by change polarity of LED. (Like principle of Bi-color LED) 

For example, forward polarity connected to LED will grow RED color LED, but in reversed polarity connected to LED will grow GREEN color LED. 

Our twinkling light with changing color of LED has two wire that able connect to power. 

So, I decided to build my circuit with H-Bridge LED driver for switching colour of LED.
